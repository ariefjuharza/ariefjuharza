# 👋 Hello, I'm Arif Juharza

I'm a self-taught developer passionate about building clean, fast, and thoughtful digital experiences — from simple websites to full-featured Android applications. I enjoy working with static site generators, modern CSS frameworks, and tools that improve performance and maintainability.

Currently, I'm focused on developing independent web projects and open-source tools, while occasionally writing about what I learn.
